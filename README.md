How to run the code:-

1) gcc -o data data.c
2) ./data

This will create all the data files required for the program.

3)gcc -o server server.c -lpthread
4)gcc -o client main_client.c

Now, we run ./server on one terminal followed by ./client on another terminal and test our project code in the form of menu-driven format
